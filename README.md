## Description
A code along simple `Rails` Blog application to get used to `Rails` conventions and environment. I done this as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com)'s Ruby On Rails curriculum. I don't know why but I love learning Ruby and Rails. But that doesn't mean I don't like other languages and frameworks. I love them too. But Ruby and Rails are special to me.
